Spirits:
- Place object onto spirit editor, this will add the "Spirit" tag as well as basic scripting
- Set name of spirit for the object
- Add tag to object for spirit's complexity, one of the follow:
  - "Low"
  - "Moderate"
  - "High"
  - "Very High"
- Add snap points to presence track
- Presence track elements:
  - For non any elements that appear on presence tracks grab object from the element bag (one next to energy bag)
  - Set the state to match the element
  - If multiple elements appear on same spot simply stack elements on top of each other
  - Once all elements are set press the "Update Elements" button
- Presence track energy:
  - For each time that energy gain increases grab energy tokens from bag and stack them onto spot
  - You don't need to put them on every spot, only when income changes. Also don't forget about starting spot if it's not zero
  - Energy tokens have a 2nd state to be used for bonus energy, i.e. Finder
  - Once all energy is set press the "Update Energy" button
- Innate thresholds:
  - Grab a threshold token (X) and place it onto object where you want the threshold decal to appear
  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold

  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the top one)
  - Note for thresholds with OR, i.e. Trickster, you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one

  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold
  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of each other as needed
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the bottom one)
  - Note that the decal will appear smaller than the actual size of the object, just a TTS limitation for how small an object can be
  - Note for thresholds with OR, i.e. Trickster, you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one

Aspects:

Expansions:
- Create a bag
- Name the bag the name of the expansion
- Add the tag "Expansion" to the bag
- Decks of cards need to be named one of the following:

  - "Minor Powers"
  - "Major Powers"
- Note using single cards in place of a deck may cause setup issues
