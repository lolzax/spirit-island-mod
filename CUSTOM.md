### Spirits
- Place object onto spirit editor, this will add the "Spirit" tag as well as basic scripting
- Set name of object to that of spirit
- Add tag to object for spirit's complexity, one of the following:
  - "Low"
  - "Moderate"
  - "High"
  - "Very High"
- Add snap points to presence track(s) where presence should be setup
- Presence track elements:
  - For non any elements that appear on presence tracks grab object from the element bag (one next to energy bag)
  - Set the state to match the element
  - If multiple elements appear on same spot simply stack elements on top of each other
  - Once all elements are set press the "Update Elements" button
- Presence track energy:
  - For each time that energy gain increases grab energy tokens from bag and stack them onto spot
  - Energy tokens have a 2nd state to be used for bonus energy (i.e. Finder)
  - Once all energy is set press the "Update Energy" button
  - Note: You don't need to put them on every spot, only when income changes
  - Note: Don't forget about starting spot if it's not zero
- Innate thresholds:
  - Grab a threshold token (X) and place it onto object where you want the threshold decal to appear
  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold
  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of each other as needed
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the top one)
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (i.e. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one
- Extra setup:
  - Create object and place on top of spirit panel
  - Tag object with "Setup"
  - `doSetup(params)`
    - `params`: **table** - contains data about player
      - `color`: **string** - is the color of the player who picked the spirit

### Power Cards
- Move card onto power card editor
- Change values that appear to match card
- Set name of object to that of power card
- Thresholds:
  - Grab a threshold token (X) and place it onto object where you want the threshold decal to appear
  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold
  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of each other as needed
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the bottom one)
  - Note: the decal will appear smaller than the actual size of the object, just a TTS limitation for how small an object can be
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (i.e. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one

### Aspects
- Add "Aspect" tag

- Note: using single cards in place of a deck may cause setup issues
